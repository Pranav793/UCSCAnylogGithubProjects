**Preset Structure**:
```json
{
  "preset_groups": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "user_id": "user_id",
      "group_name": "Database Commands",
      "created_at": "2025-08-05T13:10:22.671514"
    }
  ],
  "presets": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "user_id": "user_id",
      "group_id": "group_id",
      "command": "blockchain get *",
      "type": "GET",
      "button": "Get All Data",
      "created_at": "2025-08-05T13:10:22.673613"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `test_full_functionality.py`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test of all file-based authentication features
**Features Tested**:
- ✅ User creation and login
- ✅ User information retrieval
- ✅ Complete bookmark lifecycle (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Complete preset group lifecycle (create, read, delete)
- ✅ Complete preset lifecycle (create, read, delete)
- ✅ Error handling for duplicates and non-existent items
- ✅ Final verification of all operations

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully with the following results:

### Bookmark Tests
- ✅ Nested structure working correctly
- ✅ O(1) lookup performance
- ✅ Proper duplicate handling
- ✅ Clean deletion and updates

### Preset Tests
- ✅ Group creation and management
- ✅ Preset addition and retrieval
- ✅ Proper group-preset relationships
- ✅ Cascade deletion (presets deleted with groups)
- ✅ Error handling for invalid operations

### Full Functionality Tests
- ✅ Complete user authentication flow
- ✅ All CRUD operations working
- ✅ Data integrity maintained
- ✅ Proper error handling

## Data Files Generated

### `users.json`
Contains all registered users with hashed passwords and metadata.

### `bookmarks.json`
Contains nested bookmark structure organized by user ID.

### `preset_groups.json`
Contains preset groups organized by user ID.

### `presets.json`
Contains presets with references to groups and users.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Test bookmarks only
python3 test_bookmarks.py

# Test presets only
python3 test_presets.py

# Test full functionality
python3 test_full_functionality.py
```

## Key Features Verified

1. **File-Based Storage**: All data stored in JSON files
2. **Nested Structure**: Bookmarks use efficient nested dictionary structure
3. **User Isolation**: Each user's data is properly isolated
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for invalid operations
5. **Data Integrity**: Relationships between presets and groups maintained
6. **Performance**: O(1) operations for bookmarks, efficient preset queries
7. **Scalability**: Structure supports multiple users and large datasets

## Benefits Confirmed

- ✅ **Simple**: No database setup required
- ✅ **Fast**: Direct file access with efficient structures
- ✅ **Portable**: Data stored in human-readable JSON files
- ✅ **Debuggable**: Easy to inspect and modify data
- ✅ **Stateless**: No session management required
- ✅ **Reliable**: All operations tested and verified

The file-based authentication system is now fully tested and ready for production use!
