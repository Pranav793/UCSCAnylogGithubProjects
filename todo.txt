1. How do I define and use pre-sets?

2. Query builder <-- this bought me!
* should have an execute button
* min, max and/or avg option(s) for numerica, float and timestamp type
    --> should be within or next the box select(ed)
* Support basic WHERE condition on timestamp / insert_timestamp
    --> has no use with PERIOD function, but does work with increments + aggregation functions
```
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - X seconds / minutes /hours / days
- OR -
WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-01 12:32:45' and timestamp <= NOW()
```
* increments requires a timestamp value + aggregation on numeric / float data type
```sql
SELECT
    increments(minute, 1, timestamp), min(timestamp), max(timestamp),
    min(value), max(value), avg(value)
 FROM
    rand_data

SELECT
    increments(minute, 1, timestamp), str_value min(timestamp), max(timestamp),
    min(value), max(value), avg(value)
 FROM`
    rand_data
GROUP BY str_value
```
* missing where condition, group by, order by functionality
* missing period function is a where condition
```
SELECT
    timestamp, value
FROM
    rand_data
WHERE period(hour, 1, now(), timestamp)
```
